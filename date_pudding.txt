Date Pudding
(recipe dates to at least early 20th century)
============

ingredients:
2 c. sugar
2 T. flour
2 t. baking powder
4 eggs
0.5 c. coarsely chopped dates
0.5 c. coarsely chopped nuts (pecans are nice)
6 T. bread crumbs
1 quart whipping cream
sugar to sweeten cream
35-40 miniature marshmallows

sift together and set aside:
2 c. sugar
2 T. flour
2 t. baking powder

separate 4 eggs; beat whites until stiff peaks form and beat yolks until lemon-colored.
fold whites and yolks gently into dates and nuts, then add bread crumbs and mix into
previously-prepared sugar mixture. Spread mixture into a greased parchment paper-lined
baking sheet and bake at 325 degrees for 45 minutes. (should be light to medium brown
when finished, and still gooey inside. this stuff is incredibly sticky until it cools,
so greased parchment paper is key - otherwise you'll be picking bits of paper off the
bottom for an hour.)

allow mixture to cool in pan, then crumble into chunks and mix with sweetened whipped cream.
fold in marshmallows and chill. makes a lot.
