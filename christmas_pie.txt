White Christmas Pie

1 baked pie shell (pastry or graham cracker crusts both work well)

dry ingredients:
1/2 c. sugar
1/4 c. flour
1 envelope of gelatine
1/2 t. salt

liquid:
1 3/4 c. milk
3/4 t. vanilla
1/4 t. almond extract

meringue:
3 egg whites
1/4 t. cream of tartar
1/2 c. sugar

1/2 c. whipping cream
1 c. sweetened moist coconut flakes

Blend dry ingredients thoroughly, transfer to saucepan and then gradually stir in milk and cook over medium heat until it boils. Boil one minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and continue stirring until the mixture forms soft mounds, then add vanilla and almond.

Beat together egg whites, cream of tartar and sugar until peaks form, then fold meringue into pie filling. Beat cream until peaks form and fold  into the pie filling. Fold coconut into pie filling and pour filling into pie shell. Decorate with green and red maraschino cherries and chill two hours before serving cold.
