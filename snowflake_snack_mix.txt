Snowflake Snack Mix

1 0.5 lb. bag pretzel twists
6 c. rice chex (half of a 13 oz. box)
2 c. cashews
1 c. pecans
1 9 oz. bag Fritos
1 11 oz. bag holiday M&Ms
1 5 oz. bag white chocolate snowflake pretzels
1 c. brown sugar, packed
1 t. vanilla
1 t. cinnamon
0.25 c. butter
0.5 c. corn syrup (light or dark)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

In a large saucepan over medium heat, bring butter, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and
corn syrup to a gentle boil for one minute, stirring continually. In a large
mixing bowl, combine pretzel twists, cereal and nuts. Pour sugar mixture over
the cereal mixture and stir or toss to coat. Carefully pour the cereal mixture
onto the parchment-lined baking sheets. Spread evenly and bake 20 minutes,
tossing the mixture after 10 minutes to ensure even browning.

Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Once the mixture has cooled completely,
add M&Ms and white chocolate snowflake pretzels. Store in an airtight container.

Makes six quarts.
