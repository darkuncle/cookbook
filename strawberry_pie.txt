Mom's Strawberry Pie

1 qt. fresh strawberries, divided
1 9" frozen pie shell (baked according to the directions)
1 3 oz. package of cream cheese, softened
1 c. sugar
4 T. cornstarch

Bake the pie shell, then spread with the cream cheese.

Mash 0.5 qt. strawberries, then add enough cold water to make 1.5 cups. Mix
sugar and cornstarch, then fold into mashed berries. Cook the berry mixture
over medium heat until thick and clear. Pour into a metal bowl, then cool
by immersing the bowl in a sink full of cold water.

meanwhile, cut the other 0.5 qt of strawberries in half (quarters, for the big
berries), and arrange them in the cream cheese-covered pie shell. Top with the
cooked berry mixture and chill for at least an hour, or overnight. Slice, top
with whipped cream, and serve.
