Double-Chocolate Bread Pudding

"Best ... Chocolate Dessert ... EVER."

prep: 10 min. plus standing
bake: about 40 minutes
makes: 8 servings

2   c. (optionally heavy) whipping cream
1/3 c. sugar
1/4 c. whole milk
3/4 c. semisweet chocolate chips (or 6 oz. chopped; use a high-quality chocolate for best results - you'll taste the difference)
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 t. vanilla extract
6 oz. day-old French bread, cut into 3/4-in. cubes (about 4 cups)
1/4 c. semisweet chocolate chips (again, use high-quality chocolate)
1 c. heavy whipping cream

Preheat oven to 300 F. In 2-quart saucepan, heat cream, sugar and milk over
medium heat until sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat.

Add chopped chocolate, stirring with wire whisk until mixture is smooth and
chocolate melts completely. Gradually whisk in eggs and vanilla until well
combined.

Place bread in shallow 1.5 qt. or 8x8 in. glass or ceramic baking dish. Pour
chocolate mixture over bread. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes, stirring
occasionally.

Sprinkle chocolate chips on top of bread mixture. Bake uncovered for 40-45
min. or until set. Cool 10 minutes to serve warm (highly suggested) and
refrigerate to serve cold later. Serve with fresh whipped cream if you like
(again, highly suggested).
