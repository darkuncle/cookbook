Lazy Day Cobbler

3/4 stick butter/margarine
1c. sugar
1c. flour
1 1/2 t. baking powder
1/4 t. salt
3/4 c. milk
1 16 oz. can pitted unsweetened cherries
1/2c. sugar
(or 2c. fresh fruit + 3/4 c. boiling water, or use thawed frozen fruit + plus all juices. Eliminate 1/2c. of sugar if fruit is sweetened.)

Melt butter in a 9x9 pan. Beat together to make a smooth batter the cup of sugar, flour,baking powder, salt and milk. Pour over the butter but don't stir. 
Don't drain the cherries but dump entire can over the batter. Sprinkle w/ 1/2 c. of sugar. 
Bake at 350 degrees for 45 min. 
(I have had trouble with ovens on this. I have a note to bake it at 400 degrees. You may have to experiment. You can double this and bake in a 9x13 pan. That may be why the "400 degrees". Enjoy!)
