Have finally perfected my mojito recipe so that I can make an arbitrary amount (instead of by the glass):

Mix:

1 part mint-infused simple syrup
1 part fresh-squeezed lime juice
2 parts coconut rum (Malibu Black or Kula; regular Malibu is pretty weak)

Fill a glass with ice, then 1/3 to 1/2 full with mix and top off with lime fizzy water. Top with lime wedge and mint sprig.

Mint-infused simple syrup:

Dissolve 1 cup Demerara sugar in 1 cup water over medium heat in a saucepan. After fully dissolved, turn off heat and add about 20 mint leaves (slap/bruise them first)). Let sit until cool, or about 30 minutes, then strain out the mint.
