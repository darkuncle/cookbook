Beef-Ham Puffs in Mushroom Sauce (aka, meatballs & rice)

2 lb ground beef
2 3-oz. cans of deviled ham
1 c. soft bread crumbs (2 slices)
1/4 c. milk
2 eggs
2 cans cream of mushroom soup
1/2 can of milk

Mix ground beef lightly with deviled ham, bread crumbs, 1/4 c. milk, and eggs until well-blended.
Shape into walnut-sized balls.

Brown, half at a time, in a large frying pan with a little butter. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.

Blend mushroom soup into pan drippings; slowly stir in 1/2 soup can of milk (about one cup). Cook, stirring constantly, until boiling (about one minute).

Return meatballs to soup mix and cover. Simmer 15 minutes to blend flavors; serve over rice.
