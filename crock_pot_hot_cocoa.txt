Prep time:  5 mins
Cook time:  2 hours
Total time:  2 hours 5 mins
Serves: 6-8 servings; double this recipe for a party

Ingredients:

1.5 cups heavy whipping cream
1 14oz can sweetened condensed milk
6 cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cups of milk chocolate chips (can also use half semi-sweet)

I doubled this for a large party and used a 6.5 quart crock pot which was filled almost to the very top.

Instructions:
Stir together the whipping cream, milk, vanilla, and chocolate chips in a 5 quart crock pot (if doubling, use a 6-7 quart slow cooker/crock pot).
Cover and cook on low for 2 hours, stirring occasionally with whisk, until mixture is hot and chocolate chips are melted.
Once it is heated through and chocolate is melted, switch the slow cooker to the warm setting. Stir again before serving. (If you have trouble getting the chocolate to melt, turn to high temporarily).
Garnish individual cups of hot chocolate with whipped cream or marshmallows.
