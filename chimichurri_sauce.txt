Easy Chimichurri

1 cup tightly packed chopped parsley leaves
1 cup tightly packed chopped cilantro leaves (optional: ditch the parsley, go 100% cilantro)
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 onion, coarsely chopped
5 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon coarse salt
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon hot pepper flakes
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Combine parsley, cilantro, red wine vinegar, onion, garlic, salt, oregano, hot pepper flakes, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor; pulse a few times. Pour olive oil in slowly, while pulsing a few more times, until chimichurri is chopped, but not mushy.

Refrigerate until flavors have blended, about 2 hours.
