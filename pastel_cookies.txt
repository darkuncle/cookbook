Pastel Cookies
--------------
Makes 6 dozen
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

You'll need:
1.5C butter, softened (3 sticks) - MUST BE BUTTER! Margarine will not work.
1C sugar
1 3-oz. pkg jello (raspberry or lime)
1 egg
1t vanilla
4C flour
1t baking powder

Cream butter well. Mix the sugar & jello and add gradually to the butter,
creaming well. Add the egg and vanilla and beat well. Combine the flour and
baking powder and gradually add to the butter mixture. Mix well after each
addition. (Easier with a dough hook towards the end.) DO NOT CHILL - you'll
destroy your cookie press! Room temperature is plenty firm enough.

Force the dough through a cookie press onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 5-7
minutes at 375. Pull out the cookies when the edges are BARELY brown - it
only takes about 10 more seconds for them to burn on the bottom. If they seem
to be cooking too quickly, turn down the oven to 350.

NOTE: recipe can be halved. Half of a 3-oz. box of jello is 6T + 2.5t jello
(1.5 oz.).
