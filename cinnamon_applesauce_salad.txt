3 c. boiling water
2 c. unsweetened applesauce
1 T. lemon juice
0.5 c. chopped walnuts
6 oz. cream cheese, softened
0.25 c. milk

Chill till partially set. Add ½ cup broken walnuts. Pour into 8x8x2-inch pan. Blend two 3-ounce packages cream cheese, sof-tened, ¼ cup milk, and 2 tablespoons may-onnaise; spoon atop. Swirl through salad to marble. Chill firm. Serves 9.
