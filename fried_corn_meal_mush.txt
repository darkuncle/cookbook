Fried Corn Meal Mush

Mix dry ingredients, then add water to moisten into a paste. Transfer to saucepan.
To the paste, pour in 1 qt. boiling water; stir constantly over medium heat for 10-15 minutes until thick.
Pour into greased loaf pan and refrigerate until cold (overnight works well).
Unmold, slice, and fry in butter until crispy and golden-brown. Serve with butter and brown sugar.
