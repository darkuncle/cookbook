Fried Corn Meal Mush

3 c. corn meal
2 t. salt

Mix dry ingredients, then add water to moisten into a paste (around 1 cup). Transfer to saucepan.
To the paste, pour in 1 qt. boiling water; stir constantly over medium heat for 5-10 minutes until thick.
Pour into greased loaf pan and refrigerate until cold (overnight works well).
Unmold, cut into half-inch thick slices (use a wet knife and clean between slices; itâ€™s sticky), and fry on a griddle in butter over medium heat until crispy and golden-brown (takes 5-10 minutes per side). Serve with butter and brown sugar.
