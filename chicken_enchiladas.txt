Chicken Enchiladas (makes 12 large)
==================
4 c. chopped chicken, cooked (seasoned with fajita/mesquite seasoning)
8 oz. low-fat cream cheese (softened)
1 c. low-fat sour cream
1 small can chopped green chilies
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1 can cream of chicken soup
8 oz. shredded jack cheese
8 oz. shredded cheddar cheese
2 T. milk
12 flour tortillas (burrito size)

Mix milk & cream cheese with mixer. Spread onto tortillas warmed in microwave
(10 sec. per tortilla). Place about .25 c. meat on edge of tortilla, sprinkle
with cheeses, reserving a small amount for final garnish. Roll and place
seam-side down in greased 9x13 pan (glass works best), should hold 8. Use an
8x8 greased pan for the remaining 4. Mix soups, sour cream and chilies; pour
over tortilas. Bake at 350 F. for 45 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining cheeses
and return to the oven to melt (if freezing, omit final cheese until actual
baking). Slice tortillas in thirds with sharp knife before serving.
