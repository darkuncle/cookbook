Mediterranean Chicken

1 T. butter
1 T. onion, finely chopped
0.5 c. celery, chopped
1 10-oz. package frozen green beans
2 c. chicken, cooked and diced
2 cans cream of mushroom soup
0.5 t. oregano
Milk (optional)
0.5 c. roasted peanuts, coarsely chopped
Couscous

Melt butter in saucepan. Add onion, celery, and frozen beans. Cover and cook on low heat to thaw beans.
Simmer, stirring occasionally for about 15 minutes, until beans are tender. Add remaining ingredients
(except nuts). If it seems too thick, add up to 1/3 cup milk to thin.

Simmer 10 minutes longer to blend flavors, stirring occasionally. Stir in peanuts before
serving (on rice or couscous).
