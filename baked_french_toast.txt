(Can optionally be prepared the night before and left in the fridge overnight)

1/2 c. butter, softened
2/3 c. brown sugar
1 16 oz. loaf of French bread (or a dozen King's Hawaiian rolls cut in half)
6 eggs
1 c. half & half
2 t. vanilla
1 t. sugar
1 t. cinnamon
1/2 t. nutmeg
1/2 t. salt

Preheat over to 350 degrees F. Spread butter in the bottom of a 9x13 pan, then
sprinkle brown sugar over it. Cut bread into 1 inch thick slices. Beat remaining
ingredients well, then soak each piece of bread in the egg mixture and place in
the pan. Pour any remaining egg over the bread and cook at 350 degrees for 25-30
minutes. Makes 8-10 servings.
