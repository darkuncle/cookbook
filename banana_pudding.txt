Banana Pudding
Serves 4

Ingredients:
2 c. 2% milk
1/2 c. sugar
2 Tbsp. cornstarch
2 eggs
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 Tbsp. butter
1 c. vanilla wafer crumbs
3 large bananas, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds

Directions:
Pour milk into a saucepan. In a bowl, mix sugar with cornstarch, and stir it into
milk. Bring milk to a simmer over low heat, but do not let it boil. In a separate
bowl, lightly beat eggs with a fork. Pour about 1/2 cup of the warm milk mixture
into eggs, and whisk together. Pour into saucepan and simmer, whisking
constantly, until thick and bubbly, 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat.
Stir in vanilla extract and butter, continuing to stir until the butter melts.
Set aside, whisking occasionally to avoid lumps.

Line the bottom of an approximately 8-inch round serving dish with 1/3 of wafer
crumbs and 1/2 of banana slices. Pour 1/2 of pudding on top. Sprinkle with 1/3
of wafer crumbs and repeat a banana-pudding layer. Top with remaining crushed
wafers. Cover with plastic wrap and chill at least 3 hours before serving.
