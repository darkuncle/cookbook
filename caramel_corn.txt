Microwave Caramel Corn (by Janice Francis)

1 stick (.5c) butter
.25c light corn syrup
1c brown sugar, packed
.25t salt
.5t baking soda
4 qts. popped corn

Bring first four ingredients to boil in microwave, then boil 3 minutes,
stirring 2-3 times. Add baking soda.

Pour half of syrup mixture over half of popped corn in doubled brown paper bag.
Shake well and add the rest of the popped corn and syrup, then shake again.
Microwave 4:30 on high, shaking every 30 seconds. If overcooked, corn will
look too dry; if not shaken often enough, it will burn in spots in the
microwave.
