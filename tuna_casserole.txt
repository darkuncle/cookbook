Tuna Casserole

2 c. large shells
1 can cream of celery soup
1 small can of mushrooms (4 oz)
1 small can of corn (or peas)
1 7 oz. can of tuna
0.25 c. mayonnaise
0.25 c. milk (not needed when cooking in microwave)
0.5 t. salt
2 t. instant minced onion
crushed potato chips or bread crumbs (optional)

Cook macaroni until tender (in salted boiling water), about 10-12 minutes, then
drain. Combine soup and mayo (plus milk, if baking in oven) and blend well. Stir
in tuna, peas/corn, mushrooms, macaroni and minced onion. Optionally top with
bread crumbs or crushed chips. Pour in casserole dish and bake at 350 degrees
for 30 minutes, or microwave for 12-14 minutes (oven results are superior,
especially when topped).
