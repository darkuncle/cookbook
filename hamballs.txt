Hamballs (one each 9x13 and 8x8 pan)
==========
2.5 lbs. ground ham
2 lbs. lean ground pork
1 lb. lean ground beef
3 c. graham cracker crumbs (approx. 2 packages out of a box - CHECK THE DATE; even unopened packages can go bad past their due date)
3 beaten eggs
2 c. milk

Shape into 25-35 tangerine-sized balls (will fill one 9x13 pan and an additional 8x8 pan). 

Mix all sauce ingredients (below, works best in a saucepan over low heat),
pour over balls and bake at 325 F. for 1.5 hours. Serve over rice.

Freeze uncooked hamballs and sauce separately for up to six months.

Sauce (you may want to double this if your crew likes saucy rice; if so, pour this on the hamballs for baking and then make another batch for later):

2 cans tomato soup
.75 c. vinegar
2.25 c. packed brown sugar
2 t. dry mustard
