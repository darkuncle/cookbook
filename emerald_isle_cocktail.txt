Emerald Isle

**Ingredients (1 cocktail)**  
- 1.5 oz gin  
- 0.75 oz Midori (melon liqueur)  
- 0.75 oz Cocchi Americano  
- 0.75 oz fresh lime juice  
- 0.5 oz honey syrup (see below)  
- 3–4 cucumber slices (plus extra for garnish)  

**Honey syrup**  
- 1 part honey  
- 1 part hot water  
Stir until fully dissolved, cool before using.

**Method**  
1. In a shaker, gently muddle the cucumber slices.  
2. Add gin, Midori, Cocchi Americano, lime juice, and honey syrup.  
3. Fill the shaker with ice and shake hard for 10–15 seconds.  
4. Double strain into a chilled coupe or Nick & Nora glass.  
5. Garnish with a thin cucumber wheel or ribbon.

**Flavor notes / tweak ideas**  
- For a drier, more bitter profile, reduce Midori to 0.5 oz and increase Cocchi Americano to 1 oz.  
- For a sweeter, more crowd‑pleasing version, bump honey syrup to 0.75 oz.
